# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Airbnb Analysis for Chicago and New Orleans

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data for the cities of Chicago and New Orleans. Using Python in Google Colab and Tableau Server, we performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to gain insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings, including property types, pricing trends, host demographics, and more.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data cleaning and transformation in Google Colab
- Tableau Server for further data transformation
- Tableau for data visualization and interactive dashboards
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in Chicago and New Orleans, including property details, pricing, availability, host information, and guest reviews. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing data formats. Data transformation steps included feature engineering, merging datasets, and creating aggregated views for analysis.

## Insights Overview
### 1. Overview of Airbnb
- Total number of listings in Chicago and New Orleans
- Distribution of property types (e.g., apartments, houses, condos)
- Availability trends and occupancy rates

### 2. Property Analysis
- Analysis of property amenities and their impact on listing popularity
- Comparison of property types based on pricing and occupancy rates
- Geographic distribution of Airbnb listings in each city

### 3. Pricing Analysis
- Average nightly rates for different property types and neighborhoods
- Seasonal pricing trends and peak booking periods
- Factors influencing pricing variations (e.g., amenities, location, ratings)

### 4. Host Analysis
- Demographic analysis of Airbnb hosts (e.g., age, gender, experience)
- Host responsiveness and review ratings
- Impact of host characteristics on booking success
